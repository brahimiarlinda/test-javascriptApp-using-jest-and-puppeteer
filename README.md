# Run the tests and visualize them on the browser

Open the terminal and run:
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. npm test

How to see the coverage:
1. At the terminal you need to see the report of the testing coverage. It is provided by Jest (check package.json).
2. A new folder, named "coverage" will be created (refresh if you don't see it). Open in the browser the index.html file (/coverage/lcov-report/index.html). Click on the file to see the lines of the code-base not covered.
